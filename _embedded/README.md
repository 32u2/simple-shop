### Nothing related to the project here - go away

>An Easter egg is a secret image, message, feature, or action that is embedded within a movie, video game, application, or other media/program. Sometimes a reference to another recognizable pop culture item, an Easter egg is often put in place purely for entertainment purposes.

>(...) The term “Easter egg” was coined to describe such an artifact in 1980, when Atari unknowingly released its Adventure console game with a hidden credit for one of its programmers, Warren Robinett. Although the discovery of the message initially sparked controversy among Atari leaders, the inclusion of “Easter eggs” became a cultural phenomenon that would later be widely adopted by software developers, movie directors, and video game creators alike.

So, yes, the short stories, music and poetry embedded into the repo are my thang. Tis postmodern and conceptual, so really nothing to see here.

This particular song is also available on my [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/bbest-o).

Speaking off, if you are still reading this and you happen know anyone who has done a similar thing before, please open an Issue and leave their repo link - I'd really appreciate that.
